## Using encryption for sensitive data
The above link is still valid, however
If anyone can set their hands on your private keys, they can do whatever they want with your funds / axies.
Please prefer the encryption method describe below
For that you will need the cryptography package:

 ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

You can list the config possibility with the command:

 ```bash
python config.py --help
 ```

### New configuration

If you want to create a new configuration, juste launch the command:

 ```bash
python config.py --create
 ```

### To encrypt an existing configuration file

If you have already json file with the config information, you can convert it to an encrypted config.
You can delete your json file after that.

 ```bash
python config.py --convert_clear file_path <file_path>
 ```

### To add or delete scholars from your config

 ```bash
python config.py --add
 ```

 ```bash
python config.py --delete
 ```

### To display the current state of the config

 ```bash
python config.py --display
 ```

### Launching payouts

To launch the payouts using the encrypted config, no args should be provided:

 ```bash
python PayoutScript-xyZ.py
 ```
